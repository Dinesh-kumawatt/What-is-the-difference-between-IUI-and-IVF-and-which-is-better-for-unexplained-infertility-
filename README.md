People often mix up IUI and IVF, but they are very different. IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) is a simple, less expensive procedure where washed sperm is placed directly into the uterus during ovulation. IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) is more complex â€” eggs are taken out, fertilized in the lab, and the best embryo is placed back in.

For unexplained infertility (which means doctors can't find a clear reason why youâ€™re not conceiving), many doctors first try IUI. Itâ€™s not too invasive and might work in 2â€“3 cycles. But the success rate for IUI is lower (around 10-15% per cycle) compared to IVF (40-50%).

IVF is usually recommended if IUI fails, if the woman is over 35, or if thereâ€™s a hidden issue like low egg reserve, sperm problems, or blocked tubes. IVF also gives more controlâ€”doctors can select the best embryo and avoid poor-quality ones. It also helps avoid genetic problems if PGD/PGT testing is done.

At clinics like Trinity IVF Ahmedabad, the doctors start with thorough tests and suggest IUI or IVF based on real need. They wonâ€™t push IVF unless itâ€™s really needed. Thatâ€™s helpful because you wonâ€™t waste time or money on the wrong treatment.
